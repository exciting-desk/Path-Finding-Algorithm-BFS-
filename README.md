# Path-Finding-Algorithm-BFS
This script is a command-line program that allows users to either create a maze, 
including adding and removing walls, setting a starting and ending point, 
and finding the shortest path between the two points using a pathfinding algorithm or generate a 10x10 one. 
The program also includes a "help" option to display the available commands and a "reset" option to clear the current maze and start over. 
The program uses 'input()' and try/except statements to validate user input and ensure that all necessary information is entered before finding the shortest path. 
The final maze and path are displayed using the 'draw()' function.
